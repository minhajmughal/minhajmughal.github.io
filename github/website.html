                    What is Chat GPT?
                </h3>
                <p id="para1">ChatGPT is a large language model developed by OpenAI that can generate human-like responses to a wide range of prompts. It is a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence language model that uses deep learning techniques to understand and
                    generate natural language. ChatGPT is trained on massive amounts of data from the internet, which allows it to generate responses that are coherent, fluent, and often indistinguishable from those of a human. ChatGPT has many potential
                    applications, including chatbots, language translation, text summarization, and more.</p>

                <h2>
                    How Chat GPT use AI technology to complete its task?
                </h2>
                <p id="para2">
                    ChatGPT uses AI technology, specifically deep learning, to complete its task. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that involves training artificial neural networks to recognize patterns in data. To train ChatGPT, OpenAI fed it vast amounts of
                    text data from the internet, including books, articles, and websites. The model then uses this data to learn the patterns of language, such as syntax and grammar, as well as the nuances of meaning and context. When a user inputs a
                    prompt or question, ChatGPT uses this trained knowledge to generate a response. The model breaks down the input into a series of tokens and applies its understanding of language patterns to predict the most likely next word or sequence
                    of words to form a coherent response. ChatGPT also has the ability to learn and adapt over time as it receives more data and user feedback, which allows it to continually improve its responses and accuracy.
